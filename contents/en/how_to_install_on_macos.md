# How to install Ruby on MacOS

## Installing Rbenv

- It's sooooo easy! Check out the same instalation on [Ubuntu](how_to_install_on_ubuntu.md) and compare!
```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install rbenv
```

## Installing Ruby

Please, pay attention, very difficulty ahead!

- List all available Ruby versions:
```bash
$ rbenv install -l
```

- Install a Ruby version (in 10-11-2016 the currently ruby version is 2.3.1):
```bash
$ rbenv install 2.3.1
```

- Nice! and now, type `irb` (is for `interactive ruby shell`) on your console and FEEL THE MAGIC
```bash
$ irb
irb(main):001:0> _
```

And now you can go to your [first command]() on irb or [go back](../README.md) to README!
